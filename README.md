# Task Management Server
Developing a Task Management System üìù using NestJS is an ideal way to apply my recent learning.

Starting simple, I will gradually add functions such as task prioritization, due dates, and collaboration. By incrementally enhancing the system, I will gain hands-on experience in API routing, authentication, error handling, and more. This step-by-step approach builds a solid understanding of NestJS while letting me explore complex features later.
